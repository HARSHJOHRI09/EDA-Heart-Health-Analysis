# EDA-Heart-Health-Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing patient data to identify key factors contributing to heart disease and to create a profile of high-risk patients. The dataset contains various health indicators such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, resting ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.
The main goal is to use data-driven insights to help healthcare professionals predict heart disease risk early and improve patient outcomes.

The dataset was cleaned using Excel, and the analysis part was performed using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Visualizations were created to understand patterns and correlations between medical attributes and the presence of heart disease.

Through this analysis, actionable recommendations are made to help reduce the risk of heart disease through better preventive measures and early diagnosis.

 Key Highlights:

Data Cleaning: Performed in Excel (handling missing values, duplicates, formatting)

Exploratory Data Analysis: Done in Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Insights: Key factors like age, cholesterol, and chest pain type play a major role

Goal: Identify high-risk patients and improve treatment decisions
